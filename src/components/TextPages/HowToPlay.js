        You will be choosing four golfers per tournament. For each
        tournament you’ll have one final scorecard and score. Each round's
        score is calculated by taking the lowest score between your four
        golfers for a given hole. For example if three of your golfers
        bogey and one birdies, your scorecard will show the birdie as -1.
        The name of the game is best ball, after all.
