        Fantasy golf best ball had its heyday just a few short years ago.
        People – golf fans and novices alike – bonded over this game, one
        filled with skill, excitement, and bragging rights. Unfortunately,
        for reasons unknown, the game was stripped away from us faster
        than Bryson DeChambeau can swing a golf club.

        We have some exciting news: fantasy golf best ball is back!
        Introducing Best Ball Majors: the premier offering of the classic
        game – resurrected by the fans, for the fans.

      <p className="aboutText">
        We are a group of friends who decided to rebuild best ball in our
        spare time. Everything is done in-house, from coding to marketing
        to design. We hope to keep upgrading the platform following
        launch, but please understand: this is a free service, and we must
        keep our expenses low. If you want to help us keep the dream alive
        please contact us to donate at help.bestballmajors@gmail.com.

        We hope you enjoy our inaugural season. With any luck, we’ll see
        you back when Agusta rolls around again.
